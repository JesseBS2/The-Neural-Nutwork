# The Neural Nutwork

This is a bot I decided to create to assist in math, it is my biggest passion project by far and I have been working on it ever since December 2019.
While the bot is good at my original vision(doing math), I am hoping to expand it into a wider variatey of education; Chemistry & Biology being at the top of my list.
At the current moment, there is nothing Neural about "The Neural Nutwork", the name is just a play on the title "Neural Network". But I hope to soon add in a learning capability via `brain.js`.

This code in this repository is actually considered v2 of the bot, and it is way better and easier to understand than v1.
Version 1 of the bot actually took place all in one file, which did remove the need of global variables(which *can* be removed but I like them). But it also made the code very cluttered, and as a result, had one really long file.
Now the files are separated and easy to read; Which is like 10,000x better!

The bot will (hopefully) be accessable on much more than just Discord in it's complete form;
I should mention that there is no server for the bot, so it's not normally online, so there is no point in providing a link to the bot


Have a good one! :)<br/>
