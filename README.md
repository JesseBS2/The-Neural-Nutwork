# The Neural Nutwork

Packages:<br/>
`discord.js v11.5.1`<br/>
`algebra.js v0.2.6`

This is a bot I decided to create to assist in math, it is my biggest passion project by far and I have been working on it ever since December 2019.
While the bot is good at my original vision(doing math), I am hoping to expand it into a wider variatey of education; Chemistry, Biology being at the top of my list.
At the current moment, there is nothing Neural about "The Neural Nutwork", the name is just a play on the title "Neural Network". But I hope to soon add in a learning capability via `brain.js`.

Where did the name "Nutwork" come from?
Well, take a lonely programmer needing a name for a network, and throw in a couple friends all being nuts, you'll get a Nutwork.


The bot is will (hopefully) be accessable on much more than just Discord in it's complete form; Such as Twitch, or a website of it's own.
Until then, an invite link for the Discord version is here:<br/>

Have a good one! :)<br/>
